# Election_Analysis

## Project Scope

We have been hired to conduct an audit of the most recent congressional election covering Arapahoe, Denver, and Jefferson counties. The areas we will include the following. 

- A full tabulation of all of the votes cast in the election
- Determine the candidates in the election and how many votes each recieved
- Calculate the percentage of the total votes cast that each candidate recieved
- Ascertain the winner of the election
- Determine the voter turnout for each county
- Calculate the percentage from each county out of the total count
- Find the county with the highest turnout

## Resources

- #### Election Audit Summary
  - This script can be used for virtually any election. It can be scaled for statewide or even nationwide
  - One way we could modify the script would be to look a breakout of each candidate's vote by county 
  - We could even change this to drill down into city data
  - The applications are pretty broad for this script as it can be used to evaluate not just places but people or people at certain income levels
